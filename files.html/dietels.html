<h1 class="title"><u>EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS, TOP 10 GREATEST PHARAOHS IN ANCIENT EGYPT :</u></h1>
<p>The pharaohs of ancient Egypt reigned supreme. They were regarded as both gods and political figures.
  The pharaohs inherited the crown through the royal bloodline where the king, the father, left the throne after
  his death to his eldest son. Countless pharaohs have ruled over Egypt making it one of the greatest civilizations ever.
  Not all of these played a key role in molding the great history of Egypt but the ones who did are marked out forever in this golden period of history.
  The pharaohs were so important to their people that they were compared to Egyptian gods such as Horus and Osiris with titles such as the Son of Re
  being used too. Their role was so much more than simply emperor, which led to their god-like status. The construction of a pharaoh’s tomb was a major task in
  Egypt as the pharaohs wanted to be reborn victoriously in the afterlife. Architects worked hard to provide protection for the tombs by constructing pyramids over them.
  In order to acknowledge just a few of these exceptional pharaohs, here's a list of the top 10 of all time:</p>

Hatshepsut bags the title of the most successful female pharaoh to ascend the throne of Egypt.
The fifth ruler of the 18th dynasty of Egypt,Hatshepsut reigned between 1478 BC and 1458 BC.
As the wife, daughter, and sister of a king, Hatshepsut not only shared the royal bloodline
but also inherited the art of ruling from her royal family. Although the status of woman in
ancient Egypt was high, female pharaohs were rare.It is believed that King Thutmose I wanted
his daughter to inherit the throne. After her husband's death, Hatshepsut took over the throne
andreigned for over 21 years. She accomplished a lot more than many other pharaohs could have
done during their reign. From initiating countless construction projects to establishing routes
for foreign trade , everything was accomplished smoothly, and the people enjoyed peace under her
government. The famous temple  of Hatshepsut is a mortuary temple she built for herself.

Thutmose was the heir to the 18th dynasty of Egypt and the stepsonof the previous pharaoh Hatshepsut.
Being the only son of King Thutmose II, he was supposed to take over the throne after his death,
but he was only two years old at the time so his stepmother Hatshepsut ascended the throne while
he became her co-regent. His reign lasted for 54 years and he died at the early age of 56, but his
contribution to Egyptian civilization is still considered as one of the greatest. Widely known as
the “Napoleon of Egypt,” Thutmose had a wide list of accomplishments and military achievements.
The expansion of the Egyptian kingdom under his reign was notable. Thutmose was also considered
a great warrior who fought many enemies to protect Egypt and its people. He contributed a great
deal to the construction of various sites and his most renowned contribution is the temple at Karnak.
One of the obelisks from this temple was re-erected as the Obelisk of Theodosius in Istanbul, Turkey.
Thutmose's mummy was discovered in the Valley of the Kings where he was buried with other pharaohs
of the same dynasty.</p></pre>

Ramesses II was the third pharaoh of the 19th dynasty and one of the greatest pharaohs of the
New Kingdom of Egypt. Egyptians often call him “the Great Ancestor.” Ramesses is said to have
had a victorious military career that highly benefited the kingdom. He led several military
expeditions and conquered many enemies like the Hittites, Syrians, and Nubians. It is believed
that no pharaoh has ever surpassed his architectural triumphs. He built an extensive amount of
monuments spread all over Egypt that are now a proud part of Egyptian heritage. He died at the
age of 90 and was buried in the Valley of the Kings.Ramesses' unusual contributions continued
after his death too when his remains were sent to archaeological authorities in France for
restoration The Egyptian officials had to issue a passport for the deceased pharaoh’s body to assure
a legal and safe return. Proper documents were prepared with a passport that had “King (deceased)”
written as his occupation. The mummy was received at the airport with every military honor due to a king.</p>

Amenhotep's rule is remembered as one of artistic glory and prosperity. He was the ninth
pharaoh of the 18th dynasty whose reign lasted from 1391 BC to 1353 BC. He had a large impact
on the economy of Egypt which blossomed under his reign thanks to the healthy trade relations at
this time. He contributed a great deal to the field of art by building many monuments, statues,
and stone scarabs that are still in good condition today. Many texts were found engraved on
these scarabs during excavations depictinga variety of historical events. He is credited as the
pharaoh with the largest number of his own statues.</p>

The most famous pharaoh of all time is King Tutankhamun. He ascended the throne at the tender
age of nine or 10 but his reign only lasted from 1332 BC to 1323 BC.Although the young king
introduced many religious reforms he was not well renowned for his achievements as a ruler.
His fame comes more from the discovery of his nearly intact tomb. Tutankhamun’s death is
still a matter of controversy as no conclusions have been drawn as to how he died, but his
mummy was important for Egyptologists to conduct valuable research into the process of
mummification.</p>

    <h3>Cause of death</h3>

    <div class="TUTANKHAMUN1"><img src="../image/6.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <pre>
    <p class="p7">
There are no surviving records of the circumstances of Tutankhamun's death; it has been the subject
of considerable debate and major studies. Hawass and his team postulate that his death was likely
the result of the combination of his multiple weakening disorders, a leg fracture, perhaps as the
result of a fall, and a severe malarial infection. However,Timmann and Meyer have argued that sickle
cell anemia better fits the pathologies exhibited by the king, a suggestion the Egyptian team has called
"interesting and plausible".Murder by a blow to the head was theorised as a result of the 1968 x-ray which showed two
bone fragments inside the skull. This theory was disproved by further analysis of the x-rays and the CT scan. The inter
-cranial bone fragments were determined to be the result of the modern unwrapping of the mummy as they are loose and not
adherent to the embalming resin. No evidence of bone thinning or calcified membranes, which could be indicative of a fatal
blow to the head, were found. It has also been suggested that the young king was killed in a chariot accident due to a
pattern of crushing injuries, including the fact that the front part of his chest wall and ribs are missing. However,
the missing ribs are unlikely to be a result of an injury sustained at the time of death; photographs taken at the
conclusion of Carter's excavation in 1926 show that the chest wall of the king was intact, still wearing a beaded
collar with falcon-headed terminals. The absence of both the collar and chest wall was noted in the 1968 x-ray and further
confirmed by the CT scan. It is likely that the front part of his chest was removed by robbers during the theft of
the beaded collar;the intricate beaded skullcap the king was pictured wearing in 1926 was also missing by 1968.</p>

Cleopatra VII Philopator was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51
to 30 BC,and its last active ruler.A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty,she was a descendant
of its founder Ptolemy I Soter a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander
the Great.After the death of Cleopatra,Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking
the end of the second to last Hellenistic state and the age that had lasted since the reign of
Alexander (336 - 323 BC).Her native language was Koine Greek, and she was the only Ptolemaic
ruler to learn the Egyptian language. In 58 BC , Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father,
Ptolemy XII Auletes, during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a Roman client state)
allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne.Berenice was killed in 55 BC when
Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance.When he died in 51 BC,the joint
reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began,but afalling-out between them led to
open civil war After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius
Caesar (a Roman dictator and consul)in Caea's Civil War, the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt.
Pompey  had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII,but PtolemyXIII at the urging of his court eunuchs,
had Pompey ambushed and dcj killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria.Caes
then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings  , but Ptoleddmy's chief adviser, Potheinos, viewed Caesar's ter
as favoring Cleopatra , so his forces besieged her  and  Caesar sjgdh at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted b
reinforcements,Ptolemy XIII  ahjha died in the 47 BC  Battle of the Nile; Cleopatra's half-sister Arsinoe IV was eventual
exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege.dsdcdd Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joi
rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that dssd produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as
client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's villa.dfd After the assassinations of Caesar and (on her order
Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV. In the d Liberators' civil war of (43 - 42) BC, Cleopat
sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar's grandnephew d and heir Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemil
Lepidus.After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsi
at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding sand military aid during his invasions of t
Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children Alexander Helios, Cleopat
Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority.This ev
their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister Octavia Minor led to thes final war of the Roman Republic. Octa
engaged in a war of propaganda,forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC,and declared war on Cleop
After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 B
defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triu
procession, she killed herself by poisoning, contrary to the populard belief that she was bitten by an asp.Cleopatra's le
survives in ancient and modern works of art.Roman historiography andd Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of
queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include Roman b
paintings, and sculptures, cameo carvings and glass, Ptolemaic ansd Roman coinage, and reliefs.In Renaissance and Baroque
she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become
culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine
burlesque satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.
